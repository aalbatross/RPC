Simple RPC implementation
Runs fine writing services beware
Points to be noted:
1. Write Services using Wrapper classes Java Types (Use Integer instead of int).
2. Use Map as arguments to methods instead of passing a class (Schema can share the information of fields required to pass) at Service.   Using a map is an issue need to be seen.
